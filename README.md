MY name is Adam Debaere, or adamdebadam for short. I am new to coding and just starting out on my journey to becoming a web developer. My goal is finding a career that i look forward to getting out of bed in the morning for. My target is to be desgning and building cool websites in the next 3 years. I am 27 now, so by the age of 30 I aim to be working in the dev industry. Good day!
